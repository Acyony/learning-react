This API has been created for learning purposes. Its core functionality involves sending a request to an endpoint. 
Upon receiving the response, the data is then consumed within the frontend of the application.

# To improve
There are still a lot of things that I can do to Improve this single api, and one I would like to poin out it that
when there are no more new pictures to display, the message "No more Characters to show ٩(˘◡˘)۶" suddenly 
appears on the page. This abrupt appearance leads to unexpected changes in the layout, which can impact the 
layout shift scores in a real application, as explained in the [CLS documentation](https://web.dev/cls/).
