This API has been created for educational purposes. Its core functionality involves sending a request to an endpoint. 
Upon receiving the response, the data is then consumed within the frontend of the application.


# To improve
When there are no more new pictures to display, the message "No more Characters to show ٩(˘◡˘)۶" suddenly 
appears on the page. This abrupt appearance leads to unexpected changes in the layout, which can impact the 
layout shift scores in a real application, as explained in the [CLS documentation](https://web.dev/cls/).
